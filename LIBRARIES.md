### Updated Project Flow: How Libraries Interact

1. **Initial Setup**:
    - **Vite** serves the app, bundles the code, and ensures fast development iterations. **TypeScript** provides type safety across the codebase.
    - **Storybook** is used for isolated development of components, allowing you to view them in isolation and test their functionality.

2. **UI Rendering**:
    - **Material UI** components are styled with **Emotion** and integrated into the app's UI.
    - **Framer Motion** adds animations to elements, enhancing the UX.

3. **State Management**:
    - **Zustand** manages the global state (e.g., theme, user authentication) and handles asynchronous actions.
    - **MSAL** ensures that user authentication is handled securely with **Microsoft Entra ID**.

4. **Routing**:
    - **TanStack Router** manages navigation between pages, like the `HomePage` and `OtherPage`. It supports type-safe routes and automatic prefetching.

5. **Data Fetching**:
    - Data is fetched either via the **React 19 `use()`** or from **MSW** during development to mock API responses.
    - **Zod** is used to validate the structure of the fetched data to ensure it matches the expected type.
